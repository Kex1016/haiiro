It's been some time since I last wrote here. Fear not, for I have big plans for Haiiro! But more on that later. It's now 2025! Happy (very late) new year! I hope you're doing well.

It is also my 7th year of using Linux, and around the 4th or 5th year of using it without a dual-boot fallback. I don't quite remember when I removed Windows completely. I will be making a post about my journey soon-ish, so stay tuned for that. This post is really just a practice of sorts.

Anyways, back to the plans, I will reveal two things for sure right here, and that will be... a new theme, and a somewhat quicker way for me to write posts. I have haiiro-generator, and it is awesome, however I am planning to make a script on the server side to periodically just git sync and rebuild the site for me. That way I don't even have to touch it!! Wow!

The new theme will probably just be like this current one with a little bit more _"pizazz"_. Look forward to it!
