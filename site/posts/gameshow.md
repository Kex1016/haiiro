# Hello again!

It wasn't as long as I imagined between my last post and this one. Yeah, so this happened. Around a week or two ago I got contacted by a friend about a gameshow he's hosting as an event on a Discord server we're part of. He asked me if I could maybe make a website to display the questions he's going to ask, along with the answers. I agreed after I was done with my exams, and made a dead simple site. Seriously, there's nothing special about it.

I used [React](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the main frameworks, and added [nstate](https://github.com/zaaack/nstate) for easy state management, this way I didn't have to do anything fancy just to store some basic data. Like I said, the site is really simple, all it does is display all the questions the person imports in a random order:

<video controls style="max-width:100%;">
  <source src="https://safe.haiiro.moe/TMU2yeyvt55t.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

That's it, really. It's small like I said, but I think I will definitely put up all of my really small projects, since who knows who might find them, and maybe even make use of it. Small projects like this are keeping me interested and excited about coding, so I will definitely continue them. Check this project out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kex1016/morfin-gameshow)!

_Yes, the title is Gayshow, and yes, I did not replace the default Vite favicon. It's not what matters!! (Maybe next commit...)_
