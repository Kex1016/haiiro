# A small update.

Recently I've steered away from all of JS/TS and (kind of) even web. I've decided
to learn Rust completely on a whim, and to be fair, I went in with *zero*
expectations, thinking it would be just one of the many languages I would
never really use. And I still think that might be the case. BUT! From the two
little projects I've started so far, I've been really enjoying it. The
syntax is ugly, sure, but holy crap it's fast, and the compiler is so damn
helpful. I might be too used to compilers throwing
"random generic error #45432" at my face, but Rust's compiler... it tells me
which line is wrong, why, and EVEN GIVES ME SUGGESTIONS TO FIX IT??? Typescript
could never. I still love it a lot though, npm has some excellent stuff in
its ecosystem, but now I can finally use something else that I enjoy for more
back-end stuff or even some CLI tools!

For now, I will work on the two projects I've started
(Asuka, who is not yet updated to the Rust version so no link,
and [Shigen](https://github.com/Kex1016/shigen)), and see where it goes.
I also want to go back to NixOS when I have some more time, that whole system's
been my favorite way to use Linux so far. I'm currently on Nobara, which is
pretty much Fedora with gaming tweaks, but since I got a separate SSD for games,
and that one is running Windows, I don't really need the gaming tweaks anymore.
_I might as well go back to NixOS, right?_ I do have [my config](https://github.com/Kex1016/my-nixos)
that I adored when I used it, it's really just a matter of time and effort.

Well, that is all for now. Have a great day! Hopefully my next post will be
about a project. Oh, and you might've noticed that I also reworked all my
posts' tags. I've made it a rule to not use more than 3 tags per post, and
also to have them a little more broad. I have also corrected some mistakes
in the [about page](/~cakes/about).
