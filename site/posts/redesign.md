# Haiiro.moe gets a new design!

It's about time I actually update this website. The Hugo theme was really
great, but the stuff I did to that thing to add the full-screen haiiro
logo for example is just way too hacky for my taste. Soooo... instead
I made an even more hacky static site generator. Such is the lifecycle
of a hobby project.

This new system is a lot simpler than Hugo, however it is tailored
exactly to my needs. Who cares about fancy stuff when I can literally
just generate my whole page, tags and all, with just "vanilla" HTML, CSS
and barely and JavaScript. I say "vanilla" because I actually used Pug
for HTML and Sass for CSS, but they all compile down to regular old HTML.

## What's the difference?

For starters, the site has a lot less fancy elements and even less images.
I intend to make some themes for it too if I get inspired, and this makes
things way easier for me and my sanity. The comments also got moved to
GitHub Discussions, because I feel like GitHub is a lot more trusted
than something like Disqus, which I only heard about because of sketchy
pirate sites.

A big difference will (hopefully) be the amount of posts. I want to
write about a lot more useless things, like the Jeopardy clone I made
just for one event on Discord, or the fully *scalable(tm)* API I built
just for some Discord bot that for that same server... And maybe even
some life updates, or ramblings that I just can't not write down.

## Basically...

All the old posts are still here, and if things go well there will be
even more coming.

*Thank you for reading :D*
