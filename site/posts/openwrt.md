**[I've added micro posts!](https://github.com/Kex1016/haiiro/commit/85d508f73fadfebf00b0e26ac39310071060cf2b)
They're like regular posts, except only on the homepage. And smaller.**

The past few weeks I've had a ton of problems with my ISP and my own
router as well. I've been using a TP-Link Archer C5 v4 for a few years
now, it's been a decent enough router. However after my electricity
went out around a week ago, the router has been acting up. It's been
dropping the PPPoE connection every few hours, and the only way to fix
it is to reboot the router, or to disable and re-enable the WAN
connection.

I tried a lot of things, but eventually just ended up
nuking the entire thing and putting OpenWRT on it.
And you know what?
Even if it was a little bit painful, it's been a great experience! I
can't believe how much you can do with this thing. The problem is gone.
I still don't know what caused it, but at least it's fixed now.
